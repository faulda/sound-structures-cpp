# Singly Linked List Design Doc
This file contains basic design documentation for the Singly Linked List data structure.

## Basic description
A singly linked list is a collection of elements of the same type linked together
by pointers from the front of the list to the back. It allows fast insert and 
delete from any position in the list. 

## Interface
The following functions will be publically exposed on the Singly Linked List class:
- SinglyLinkedList() - constructs an empty SinglyLinkedList
- SinglyLinkedList(SinglyLinkedList) - constructs a copy of the input SinglyLinkedList
- ~SinglyLinkedList() - deallocates the memory used to create the singly linked list
- size() - returns number of elements
- push_front(T element) - adds an element onto the front of the Singly Linked List
- pop_front() - removes an element from the front of the Singly Linked List
- push_back(T element) - adds an element onto the end of the Singly Linked List
- pop_back() - removes an element from the end of the Singly Linked List
- clear() - removes all elements from the Vector
- empty() - returns true if the list contains 0 elements

## Internal Design
The Singly Linked List will be implemented as a series of Node objects, each of which will
hold an element and a "next" pointer to the next Node in the list. The size of the list
will be cached (though some calls to splice arbitrary numbers of Nodes will cause either
the runtime of splice() to be O(n) instead of O(1)).
