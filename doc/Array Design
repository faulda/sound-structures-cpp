# Array Design Doc
This file contains basic design documentation for the Array data structure.

## Basic description
An array is a fixed-length block of a certain number of elements. The array provides
O(1) random access to each of these elements for reading and writing. Once created,
an array's size does not change. Unlike C style arrays, this array will store its
size and provide an interface to callers to expose that size.

## Interface
The following functions will be publically exposed on the Vector class:
- construct(int size) - creates an Array with size number of elements
- destruct() - releases the array's internal storage memory
- size() - returns number of elements
- operator[](int index) - returns element at index

## Internal Design
The array will be implemented as a C style array.
